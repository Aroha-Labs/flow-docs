## 🛠️ Setting Up Flow Configuration

To create a **basic flow**, you need to define its configuration in a YAML file:

1. **Create a new file** named `flow.yaml`
2. **Use the following structure** to define your flow:

```yaml .yaml
# Version format ex. "0.0.1"
version: "your.version.here"

# Basic metadata for the agent
metadata:
  name: "your-flow-name"
  description: "A brief description of your flow"
  author: "your-username"                             # This username should match your account username
  tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3, ...]                       # Tags are keywords used to categorize your flow
  private: false                                      # Access control for your flows (true/false)


# Define the input variables required
inputs:
  input1:
    type: string                                      # Currently we only support String format
    description: "Description of input1"
    required: true
    example: "Example value for input1"
  input2:
    type: string
    description: "Description of input2"
    required: true
    example: "Example value for input2"

# LLM configuration
model:
  provider: "provider-name"                           # e.g., anthropic, openai, meta, etc.
  name: "model-name"

# Dataset configuration (Optional)
dataset:
  source: "author_name/dataset_name"                  # Make sure this dataset exists

# Prompt template configuration
prompt: |
  Your flow's primary instruction or role...
  You can use {input1} and {input2} placeholders to reference inputs.

# ReadME configuration
readme: |
  Your flow's readme...
  You can use raw text or markdown here.
```

## 🧪 Testing and Deploying Your Flow

### 🖥️ Local Testing

Before deploying, it's important to **test your flow locally** to ensure it functions as expected:

```python Python
from mira_sdk import MiraClient, Flow

client = MiraClient(config={"API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"})

# Basic test
flow = Flow(source="/path/to/your.yaml")
input_dict = {"key": "value"}
response = client.flow.test(flow, input_dict)
```

### 🚀 Deploying Your Flow

Once you're satisfied with your flow's performance, you can **deploy it** to the Mira Flows Marketplace:

```python Python
from mira_sdk import MiraClient, Flow
from mira_sdk.exceptions import FlowError

client = MiraClient(config={"API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"})

# Test the flow locally
flow = Flow(source="/path/to/your.yaml")
try:
    client.flow.deploy(flow)
except FlowError as e:
    print(f"Error occurred: {str(e)}")
```

---

## 🌐 Using Your Deployed Flow

Once you've deployed your flow, you can **use it** just like any other Marketplace flow. You have the flexibility to use either the **latest version** or a **specific version** of your flow.

```python Python
from mira_sdk import MiraClient, Flow

client = MiraClient(config={"API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"})

version = "1.0.0"
input_data = {"key": "value"}

# If no version is provided, it'll use the latest version by default
if version:
    flow_name = f"author/your-flow-name/{version}"
else:
    flow_name = "author/your-flow-name"

result = client.flow.execute(flow_name, input_data)
print(result)
```

### 📜 Listing Available Versions

If you need to **see what versions are available** for your flow:

```python Python
from mira_sdk import MiraClient

client = MiraClient(config={"API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"})
client.flow.get_all_versions("author/flow_name")
```

### 🔄 Updating and Deploying Again

You can **edit various aspects** of your flow, including its configuration, prompt, and parameters:

```python Python
from mira_sdk import Flow, MiraClient
from mira_sdk.exceptions import FlowError

client = MiraClient(config={"API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"})

# Load your existing flow
flow = client.flow.get("author/flow_name")

# Save your flow to a local YAML file
flow.save("/path/to/flow.yaml")

# You may then edit your flow.yaml file

# Deploy updated flow
try:
    client.flow.deploy(flow)
except FlowError as e:
    print(f"Error occurred: {str(e)}")

# In case you forget to bump the flow version, it will get bumped by default every time you deploy the same flow.
```

By following these steps, you can **create, test, deploy, and manage** your own **custom flows** on the **Mira Flows** platform. This process allows you to **contribute to the Marketplace** and **continuously improve** your flows over time. 🌟🔧

## 🏆 Best Practices

When building your own **Flow**, focus on:

### 🏗️ Architecture Design
- **Map out processing stages clearly** 🗺️
- **Define stage dependencies explicitly** 🔗
- **Plan error handling strategies** 🛡️
- **Consider performance implications** ⚡

### 🔧 Flow Implementation
- **Choose appropriate models** based on your flow requirements 🤖
- **Define clear input/output contracts** between stages 📄
- **Implement proper error handling** for each stage ⚠️
- **Document flow-specific requirements** 📝

### 🧪 Testing and Maintenance
- **Test each processing stage independently** 🧪
- **Validate the entire processing pipeline** ✅
- **Monitor performance metrics** 📊
- **Maintain comprehensive documentation** 📚
