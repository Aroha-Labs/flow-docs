Composio allows you to connect your Mira Flows with various external services and platforms, enabling automated actions based on your flow outputs. This integration bridges the gap between AI-powered flows and real-world actions.

## Step-by-Step Integration Guide

### 1. Set Up Platform Integration

First, let's set up your desired platform integration in Composio:

1. Visit [Composio](https://composio.dev/)

2. Sign in to your account & Navigate to "All Tools"

3. Search for your desired integration (e.g., Twitter, Discord, Telegram)

4. Complete the integration process and authorise your account

### 2. Obtain Integration Details

After setting up the integration, you'll need 3 key pieces of information:

1. **API Key**:

   * Go to your Composio dashboard

   * Look for the API key section at top and copy your API key.

   * You can use the default API key or create a new one

2. **Enum**:

   * Go to the actions of the app you wnt to integrate with&#x20;

   * Copy the "Enum" of the action you wish to perform

3. **Entity ID**:

   * This is generated after you complete the platform integration

   * Find it in your "connected accounts" section under tools

Here's an interactive demo showing the process:

### 3. Implement in Code

Now that you have your API key and Entity ID, you can connect your Mira Flow with Composio:

```python
from mira_sdk.mira.client.mira_client import MiraClient
from mira_sdk.mira.flow import Flow
from mira_sdk.mira.integrations.composio import ComposioConfig

# Initialize Mira client
client = MiraClient(config={"API_KEY": "YOUR_MIRA_API_KEY"})

# Load your flow
flow = Flow(source="path/to/your/flow.yaml")

# Configure input
input_dict = {
    "user": "your_username"
}

# Execute flow with Composio integration
response = client.flow.test(
    flow,
    input_dict,
    ComposioConfig(
        COMPOSIO_API_KEY="YOUR_COMPOSIO_API_KEY", #
        ACTION="PLATFORM_ACTION",  # Enum of the action you wisht o perform
        TASK="Action specific task - {content}",
        ENTITY_ID="YOUR_ENTITY_ID"  # 
    )
)
```
