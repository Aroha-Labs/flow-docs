Composio allows you to connect your Mira Flows with various external services and platforms, enabling automated actions based on your flow outputs. This integration bridges the gap between AI-powered flows and real-world actions.

## Step-by-Step Integration Guide

### 1. Set Up Platform Integration

First, let's set up your desired platform integration in Composio:

1. Visit [Composio](https://composio.dev/)

2. Sign in to your account & Navigate to "All Tools"

3. Search for your desired integration (e.g., Twitter, Discord, Telegram)

4. Complete the integration process and authorise your account

### 2. Obtain Integration Details

After setting up the integration, you'll need 3 key pieces of information:

1. **API Key**:

   * Go to your Composio dashboard

   * Look for the API key section at top and copy your API key.

   * You can use the default API key or create a new one

2. **Enum**:

   * Go to the actions of the app you wnt to integrate with&#x20;

   * Copy the "Enum" of the action you wish to perform

3. **Entity ID**:

   * This is generated after you complete the platform integration

   * Find it in your "connected accounts" section under tools

### 3. Step by Step Demo

Here's an interactive demo showing the process:

## Code Implementation

### ComposioConfig Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPOSIO_API_KEY | Your Composio authentication key | Yes |
| ACTION | Platform-specific action (e.g., "TWITTER_POST", "DISCORD_SEND") | Yes |
| TASK | Natural language description including `{content}` placeholder | Yes |
| ENTITY_ID | Platform-specific entity identifier | Yes |

### Code Example

```python
from mira_sdk.mira.client.mira_client import MiraClient
from mira_sdk.mira.flow import Flow
from mira_sdk.mira.integrations.composio import ComposioConfig

# Initialize Mira client with your API key
client = MiraClient(config={"API_KEY": "YOUR_MIRA_API_KEY"})

# Load your existing flow from YAML file
flow = Flow(source="path/to/your/flow.yaml")

# Set up your flow's input parameters
input_dict = {
    "user": "your_username"
}

# Execute flow with Composio integration
# The flow's output will automatically replace {content} in the TASK
response = client.flow.test(
    flow,
    input_dict,
    ComposioConfig(
        COMPOSIO_API_KEY="YOUR_COMPOSIO_API_KEY",
        ACTION="PLATFORM_ACTION",  # e.g., "TWITTER_POST", "DISCORD_SEND"
        TASK="Action specific task - {content}",  # {content} is required and gets replaced with flow output
        ENTITY_ID="YOUR_ENTITY_ID"  # Platform-specific identifier
    )
)
```

### What Not to Do

1. Don't forget `{content}` in TASK:
```python
# ❌ Wrong - missing {content}
TASK="Post this message"

# ✅ Correct
TASK="Post this message: {content}"
```

2. Don't modify the `{content}` placeholder:
```python
# ❌ Wrong
TASK="Send {message}"
TASK="Post {text}"

# ✅ Correct
TASK="Send {content}"
```

3. Don't use multiple `{content}` placeholders:
```python
# ❌ Wrong
TASK="Post {content} and then {content}"

# ✅ Correct
TASK="Post {content}"
```
