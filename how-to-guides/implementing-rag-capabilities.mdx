### 🎥 Video Tutorial

For a visual walkthrough of implementing **RAG**, watch our explanation video: [**RAG Implementation Tutorial**](#) 📹✨

### 🤔 Understanding RAG Implementation

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** enhances your flows with specific domain knowledge. The implementation process involves three main stages:

1. 🗂️ **Create a Dataset**: Establish a knowledge base that contains specialized information your flow will reference during execution.
2. ➕ **Add Data Sources**: Populate your dataset with relevant information from various supported sources.
3. 🔗 **Link Dataset to Flow**: Connect the knowledge base to your flow, enabling it to leverage this information during processing.

### 🆕 Creating Your Dataset

Begin by establishing your knowledge base:

```python Python
from mira_sdk import MiraClient

client = MiraClient(config={"API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"})        # Initialize client

# Create a new dataset
client.dataset.create(
    "author/dataset_name",                                     # Unique identifier
    "Description of your knowledge base"                       # Dataset purpose
)
```

### ➕ Adding Data Sources

Populate your dataset with information from various supported formats:

```python Python
# Add a PDF document
client.dataset.add_source("author/dataset_name", file_path="document.pdf")

# Add web content
client.dataset.add_source("author/dataset_name", url="https://example.com/data")

# Add multiple sources from a CSV file
client.dataset.add_source("author/dataset_name", file_path="sources.csv")
```

### 🔗 Linking Dataset to Flow

Connect your dataset to an existing flow by modifying its configuration:

```yaml .yaml
# Flow configuration with RAG
version: "your.version.here"

metadata:
  name: "your-flow-name"                # Unique identifier
  description: "RAG-enabled flow"       # Flow description
  author: "your-username"               # Your Mira Flows username

dataset:
  source: "author/dataset_name"         # Link to your dataset

# Rest of your flow configuration remains unchanged
```
